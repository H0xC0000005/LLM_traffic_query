Bubble sort repeats these steps until no swaps occur:

1. Start at the left end of the array.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent items.
3. If the left item is greater than the right, swap them.
4. Move one position right and repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the unsorted portion.
5. After each pass, the largest remaining item has "bubbled" to its correct position at the end.
6. Shrink the unsorted portion by one and begin the next pass.

Time complexity: O(n^2) in average and worst cases.  
Space complexity: O(1).

Compare each pair of adjacent items.
